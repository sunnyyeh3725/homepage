							<h3>Yale Astronomy Student Council</h3>
							
							<p>After coming to Yale Astronomy, I realized that although many graduate students
							had ideas and inspiration to improve our graduate program and the department
							in general, there was lack of a collective organization to do so. 
							</p>

							<p>In order to address this, I founded the Astronomy Student Council (ASC) in 2018, joined by 
							three other inaugural members, and led it till the summer of 2022. We established ASC
							an elected body with terms of one year for all members. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4M3L1zso1r981VQouy-vC_pOAu50h2tddrAfC0DEd0/edit?fbclid=IwAR1BLPfbbNd2x0kHqKlMdKyUTio75clAvDVbRuKihUvF5xunSEK2enU8gs4"
							target="_blank">ASC Charter</a> in order to know more about our goals and elections. During
							my years in leadership, the ASC worked on and led a variety of projects to improve our
							graduate program and to make the department more accessible and welcoming to students 
							from a variety of backgrounds. I mention a few highlights below:-

							<ul>

								<li style="padding: 2px 0px;"><b>PGRE:</b>Given that the Physics-GRE(PGRE) isn't necessarily a predictor of academic prowess and
								acted as a barrier for many URM, international students, we wanted to remove it from being 
								required in Yale Astronomy admissions. We organized departmental discussions on this topic,
								wrote and presented a report at faculty meetings demonstrating why the PGRE acts as a barrier
							    for applying to Yale, and kept working with departmental leadership on this topic for close to 
								a year. Yale Astronomy has since made the PGRE optional since 2019.
								</li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>Graduate Admissions:</b>Before the ASC was founded, the Yale Astronomy graduate program
									did not do interviews or involve current students in the admissions process. Partnering with 
									the Yale Climate and Diversity Committee, we worked with
									departmental leadership to make the graduate admissions process more fair, transparent and equitable. 
									These included introducing interviews for shortlisted students, introducing uniform question sets 
									for all interviewees and designing uniform rubrics for evaluation during interviews 
									to minimize implicit bias. We also successfully advocated for and facilitated the participation 
									of senior graduate students in the interview and selection process.</li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>Anti-Discrimination Procedures:</b> Since Yale lacked (and still does!) a Title VI office, 
										there was no clear procedures and policies in how to deal with non-Title IX complaints from students
										(such as racial harassment, academic bullying etc.) We worked with departmental leadership
										to lay down the procedures and codify who was responsible for responding in such scenarios.
										I also designed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12oSatzapLG9HJ_oC_kstYMYHOD-4zxpu/view"
										target="_blank">this poster</a> to summarize all this information! </li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>Climate &amp; Program Survey:</b> We designed and administered an extensive survey to assess departmental
									climate and satisfaction with different elements of the graduate program. Based on student feedback, 
									we compiled an extensive report of these issues and a list of actionable items to improve the graduate
									program, to improve the climate of Yale Astronomy and make it more inclusive. If you are a Yale
									affiliate, you will be able to access the report and recommendations here:-
									<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgU4BimoI4ZL36DN9CM1jlkZ7Zom25yPnqQUZlhiU0I/edit?usp=sharing" 
									target="_blank">Link 1</a> | <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLdNrsIl2_NOeHdtT7w2XHXgbU3IahdKgurKr9IO_hE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link 2</a>
									. Many of these recommendations, have now been implemented over time. </li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>Advising Guidelines:</b> The Yale Astronomy graduate program had many segments
								with "best-practices" or "unwritten rules". These often led to varying outcomes for 
								different students in the same situation. We advocated for a long time to have the entire 
								program procedures and rules written down; along with outlining specific responsibilities 
							    for an advisor and advisee post-candidacy &amp; procedures for conflict mediation. The 
							    ASC worked with a committee of faculty members to establish the advising guidelines in 2021.
							    You can access it <a href="https://astronomy.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Advising%20Guidelines.pdf" 
								target="_blank">here.</a></li>

							<h3>Yale Graduate Student Assembly</h3>
	
							<p>The Graduate Student Assembly is an elected body of Yale students in the Graduate School 
								of Arts and Sciences. The Assembly's goals are to identify the needs and concerns 
								of graduate students, consider possible solutions, and present these to the 
								Dean and other administrators. I was the Astronomy Department Representative (2018-'21) 
								and a member of the Steering Committee. At the GSA, I have focused primarily on improving Diversity, 
								Equity & Inclusion efforts, addressing a variety of international student issues, 
								and improving graduate student access to mental healthcare and housing. A few highlights are
								mentioned below:-</p>

							<ul>
								<li style="padding: 2px 0px;"><b>Mental Healthcare:</b> Yale is self-insured and thus, restricts its students primarily 
								to its own student health center (against a broader network). This resulted in extremely long
								wait times for students wanting to access mental healthcare resources. We successfully advocated
								for and obtained coverage through an external provider (Magellan), opening up access to hundreds 
								of more providers for graduate students. I also designed these resource
								poster (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D0w7ruv6r6lwRvyHKgzZNyaZ2IC2Jr9F/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Poster 1</a> 
								| <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D0w7ruv6r6lwRvyHKgzZNyaZ2IC2Jr9F/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Poster 2</a>) outlining how to access this gamut of new resources.</a></li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>Inclusive Yale:</b>I was involved in collecting feedback and responses from various departments 
									in the Natural Sciences as part of the designing of the <a href="https://belong.yale.edu/" target="_blank">
									Belonging at Yale</a> -- a slew of long term initiatives and efforts to make Yale
									more inclusive.</li>

								<li style="padding: 5px 0px;"><b>International Students:</b> I worked on a variety of efforts to improve the lives of international
								students at Yale -- focused on better integration of international students into the Yale community and updated visa procedures at Yale to support international students. I also coordinated
								with student governments at other institutions to facilitate legal recourse against exclusionary policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

							<h3>Yale Community Fellow</h3>

							<p>I have been working as a Community Fellow at Yale since 2019. As a Community Fellow (specifically assigned
							to 254 Prospect), I work to create an engaging and respectful environment that enhances the experience
							of graduate students living in Yale Housing properties. This is achieved primarily by organizing 
							various social events and community meetings/town halls.<p>
		
							<p><b>Differential Police Response:</b> During my time as community fellow, I also participated in designing
							Yale Police Department's (YPD's) differential response policy, which came into force in 2021. Under this policy, the 
							YPD automatically assigns more appropriate resources (instead of a police team) to a non-life threatening and
							non-criminal 911 calls. (e.g. community leaders responding to noise complaints instead of the police, mental 
							healthcare providers responding to an unarmed distressed person.) </p>

								<h3>Meyerhoff &amp; Granville Scholars Programs</h3>

								<p>During my time at Yale, I was involved in two specific summer research programs, which 
								   aimed at training a more diverse and socially aware next generation of scientists.
								</p>

								<p><b>Meyerhoff Scholars' Program:</b> I have mentored and supervised three highly talented 
									undergraduate students from UMBC in the Urry Lab as 
									part of the <a href="https://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">Meyerhoff Scholars Program</a> -- a program 
									focused on supporting students from historically underrepresented groups through intensive mentoring and community building. This 
									involved not only academic advising but also helping students navigate implicit challenges in academic culture and build confidence as emerging scientists.
									Responsibilities included an initial one-week period of teaching followed by twice-a-week personal meetings to support them and oversee their progress. 
									Two of the students who worked with me ended up pursuing Ph.D. programs in physics/astronomy, while another student went into industry.</p>

								<p><b>Granville Academy:</b> I have taught incoming Yale Astronomy & Astrophysics summer 
									students as part of the two-week Granville Academy in 2018 and 2019. The program, designed by Prof. Meg Urry and Prof. Louise Edwards,  
									is named in honor of Evelyn Boyd Granville, who obtained her Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale in 1949 and was the 
									second African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics in the United States. The teaching combined astronomical training 
									with social activism and discussions on diversity (e.g., Statistics of Under-Representation, Equity in the Classroom, Implicit Bias, 
									Introduction to Astronomical coding, How to Analyze Data, etc.).

							<h3>Presidency University Physics League</h3>

							<p>During my undergraduate studies at Presidency University, Kolkata; there was a lack of 
							a collective student body that work towards improving the program at Presidency. To address this,
							I co-founded the Presidency University Physics League (PUPL) in 2013. We worked primarily towards improving
							our undergraduate program by leading the organization of journal clubs, lecture series, and academic 
							field trips to various Indian research centers. I led the League till the end of my time at Presidency. </p>
							
							<p>During my time at PUPL, I also led the organization of the inaugural International Presidency University 
							   Academic Festival in 2014 -- a week-long series of $\sim$25 public lectures by leaders in sciences, arts,
							   humanities, and public policy that attracted ~500 members of the public from all over Kolkata.</p>
