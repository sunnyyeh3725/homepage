							<p> During my time at National Central University in Taiwan, I taught an undergradute course on UAV and Pix4D image processing as an Intructor. I designed the course to be very hands-on and project-based, with a focus on practical skills and real-world applications. The students learned how to operate UAVs, collect aerial imagery, and process the data using Pix4D software to create 3D models and maps. The course was well-received by the students and provided them with valuable skills in geospatial analysis and remote sensing.</p>

								<h3>Yale PHYS 378: Co. Lead Instructor</h3>

								<p>I completely redesigned and co-taught (as the instructor-of-record) an undergraduate course at the intersection of physics and data science 
									at Yale titled  &ldquo;Phys 378: Introduction to Scientific Computing &amp; Data Science&rdquo; with <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/Welcome.html" target="_blank">
									Prof. Daisuke Nagai</a>. I was selected for this via the competitive <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Associates-in-Teaching-Program" 
									target="_blank">Yale Associates in Teaching Program</a> which allows advanced Ph.D. students to expand their range of teaching experiences and responsibilities by 
									co-designing and co-teaching a course with a Yale faculty member.</p>

								<p>The goal of the course was to introduce undergraduates to modern scientific computing methods and I focused the redesign on evidence-based methods 
									 to cultivate practical expertise over passive familiarity. Given how rapidly the scientific computing landscape -- especially machine learning -- changes, traditional 
									 pedagogical materials (e.g., books or written notes) become outdated quickly. To address this, I developed a dynamic format emphasizing real-time skill building and 
									 diverse learning styles.</p>

								<p>We ran PHYS378 as a hands-on computing lab course, which met weekly for a typical 3-hour session (with a 15-minute break in the middle). Students
									 watched two short (10-minute) concept-priming videos before coming to each class to get introduced to relevant mathematical and data-science concepts. 
									 They were quizzed on these videos at the start of each class and this was followed by 40% of planned class-room instruction (slides, chalkboard, think-pair-share activities etc.); 
									 and 60% of live coding in small groups with immediate feedback from instructors and teaching assistants. During these live-coding sessions, students finished
									 short concept-forming coding tasks based on the day's material and also got started on their coding assignment for the coming week.</p>
								
								<p>We also held a series of capstone seminars led by academic researchers and industry speakers towards the latter half of the course. These were designed to 
									  give the students more examples of real-life applications of what they are learning in class and to also give them some ideas and inspiration for their final projects. 
								</p>

								<p>The 34-student class, primarily juniors and seniors, was very well received -- earning evaluations above departmental and divisional averages on every quantitative metric. The course is still taught to this day in this redesigned format.</p>

								<h3>Student Testimonials</h3>

								<p>I have always heavily used feedback from my students in order to 
								   improve both my style of instruction, and also the content of my
								   classes/sections.
